              Bryan Diaz is the founder of BAD Yoga, a space for people to stay
              curious and connect with their physical and emotional bodies. This
              passion project started after he completed a two hundred hour yoga
              teacher certification program in Rishikesh, India. His aim was to
              deepen his ten-year practice. This program augemented his
              understanding of yogic philosophy, a crucial component that is
              absent in U.S.A. yoga spaces, which he decided to share with the
              world via BAD Yoga, which is named after his own intials.

              Bryan is native to San Antonio, Texas. He is an Armand Hammer
              United World College (UWC-USA) alum and he studied Chinese and
              Dance at St. Olaf College. As a recent New Haven transplant, he
              enjoys exploring new beaches along the east coast. In his down
              time, he studies Russian and maintains his Spanish, French, and
              Mandarin.
